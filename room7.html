            <p>Upon entering this door, you instantly start shivering from the cold. You have entered a somewhat large room that looks to be made entirely of ice. Large icicles hang from the ceiling and come up from the floor. just across from you, you can see a small doorway that you just might be able to squeeze through, and directly to your left there is an oddly placed wooden door hiding behind one of the larger icicles.</p>
