            <h1>The Forest</h1>
            <p>You find yourself in a dark forest with no obvious exit. The trees tower around you as you wander a little bit from the door, but you quickly find yourself completely lost. You eventually find a small clearing. You can see the large rotting trunk of a dead tree, and on the opposite side of the clearing a tree that looks cleaner, taller, and wider than all the others. On closer inspection, there seems to be a door in both trees trunks.</p>
