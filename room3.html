            <h1>Operating Room</h1>
            <p>You enter into a clean room with 2 operating tables on opposing sides. There are metal shelves against the far wall you can see are filled with sharp, scary-looking tools. Youd better get out of here before someone tries to use them on you. When you look back at the door you came through though, it donesnt seem to lead into the room you were just in. There is also a door next to the shelves.</p>
