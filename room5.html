            <h1>The Desert</h1>
            <p>You walk through the doorway and are supprised to find yourself in a vast desert. When you look back at the door, you cant see it anymore. Everything is covered in dust, and as you start to look for an exit, an dull orange haze surrounds you. You walk for what feels like years, eating what small lizards, snakes, and scorpions you find, but you cannot seem to find any water, and with the sun bearing down on your neck, your thoat quickly becomes dry. Eventually you cannot last any longer, and you collapse from the exaustion and heat, and you die of dehydration.</p>
