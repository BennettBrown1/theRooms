            <h1>The Desert</h1>
            <p>You walk through the doorway and are supprised to find yourself in a vast desert. When you look back at the door, you cant see it anymore. Everything is covered in dust, and as you start to look for an exit, a dull orange haze surrounds you. You walk for what feels like years, before stumbling upon a strange sight. On your right is a large sand dune with a large hole in it's side, and on your left is a stone doorway that has been weathered by the wind</p>
